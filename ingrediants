Homemade Brownie Recipe Ingredients
Back to Michelle’s recipe for brownies! In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, Michelle uses granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Then, she adds these key ingredients:

2 eggs + water – Michelle uses a bit of water with the eggs to achieve 
the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial
 emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder,
 eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.
Powdered sugar – The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like
 ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken
  the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.
Unsweetened cocoa powder – Michelle recommends using Hershey’s Special 
Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). 
Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!
Oil – While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, Michelle’s
 calls for canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil 
 because it’s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.
Vanilla Extract – 1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate
 flavor.
That’s it! These fantastic homemade brownies are so easy
